#In this project, I query a database that contains multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> "Order ID"
AND orderID <> "";

#How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone";

#Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> "Order ID"
AND orderID <> "";

#Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, (SUM(Quantity) * price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
GROUP BY Product;

#Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), (SUM(Quantity) * price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;

#How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum) AS customer_count, AVG(Feb.Quantity * Feb.price) AS avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
